I am a senior data scientist at the Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health. My research focuses on developing and applying machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to Medicine, health care, public health, and well-being. Also, I am interested in developing natural language processing and machine learning algorithms that use multimodal sources (text, video, images) to summarize and gain insights about events and online communities.

Before joining Penn Medicine, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Howard University
